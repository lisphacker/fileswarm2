# fileswarm2 - BitTorrent client written in Haskell

I was inspired by [Jakub Oko≈Ñski](https://github.com/farnoy)'s [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3nr24c/writing_a_bittorrent_client_in_haskell_1/) that I thought I'd try the same exercise myself in order to get some experience working on a non-trivial Haskell development project. My [first attempt](https://github.com/lisphacker/fileswarm) was quite educational, but became rather unwieldy, so this is my second rewrite after reading about monad transformers.

I developed the code myself but have borrowed from Jakub's choice of third party libraries.

This code is in a very early developmental state and is quite unusable.
